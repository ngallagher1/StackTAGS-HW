Stacks

The file "Alice.h" is a small example of a document in a mark-up language (html).  
There are tags throughout the document.  In most cases an open tag should be followed 
at a later point by a close tag.  Sets of open and close tags may be nexted within 
other set of tags.

A tag is of the form "<tagname>" or "<tagname information>".  
The tagname is separated from the other information by a blank.

A close tag is of the form "</tagname>" where the tagname is the same as in the open 
tag.

Not all tags have close tags.  Comment tags have no close tag. A comment tag
is of the form "<!-- some text -->". (For our purposes a comment tag will be any tag
that starts with "<!" )  Some tags are complete and need no close tag.  These are tags
of the form "<tagname />" or "<tagname  information />".  That is the tag ends with 
the '/' character.

You are to write a program that reads a file that contains a document in mark-up
format and check to see that the tags in the document are correctly formatted.
That is, 
1. each open tag that requires a close tag should have one.
2. the tags should be in the correct order, that is, they are properly nested.
3. there should be no extra close tags and no missing close tags.

If you detect an error print an error message giving as much information as possible.
If you do not detect an error print an appropriate message.  Use the file Alice.h
to check your program.

As you are developing your program you may want to test using small portions of
the file Alice.h.  When your program is complete you can then test using the 
entire file.

You should submit a complete algorithm as well as a program that implements the algorithm.
Both the algorithm and the program are graded.
